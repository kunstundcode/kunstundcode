**Introduction**

This project combines the content of http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/ and the concept of http://www.experimentaldesign.eu/ in a brand new react app. You can create your own piece of art and queue it into a series of individual creations. 

**Coding process**
Our biggest challenge to mix the p5 library (https://p5js.org/), that is used by the original website, with react. After a few days of coding, we realized some workaround and tricks are definetly needed to make this work (its like water and oil), and we managed to do it! Besides practicing our freshly learn react skills, we spent a lot of time figuring out how p5 works behind the scenes and to implement it using the lifecycle methods of react. In retrospective we would have got an easier job and probably an even more awesome website, if we would have sticked to pure react and not bring in an extra challenge with a framework that is not a good friend of react. But in the end, we are proud of the result :)

**Setup**

You can clone the project like this in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/kunstundcode/kunstundcode.git
cd kunstundcode
npm start
```
